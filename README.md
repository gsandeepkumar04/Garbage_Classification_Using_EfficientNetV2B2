# Garbage_Classification_Using_EfficientNetV2B2
"A cleaner future starts with intelligent classification."

It is a deep learning-based image classification project that automatically identifies garbage types (plastic, metal, cardboard, etc.) using EfficientNetV2B2 — a state-of-the-art transfer learning model. This solution enables intelligent waste segregation and supports eco-friendly smart city applications.
